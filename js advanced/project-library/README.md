This is library project that you can add books, and delete them afterwards. Also you can "read" them or "unread" them. The "DB" is array that in real time is refreshed if you make a new entry or delete old one.<br>
The simulation of the CRUD operations is done by adding data- attribute on the buttons(more or less like primary key in DB, this was the initial idea).
